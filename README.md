The name TKproE is an acronym for TCL/TK Programming Environment.
TKproE is an integrated program development environment for the TCL/TK scripting language.
TKproE, itself, is completely written in the TCL/TK language.
TKproE supports the rapid development of sophisticated graphical user interfaces. TKproE takes
advantage of TK, a widget set that is accessible through TCL, a very efficient interpreted
programming language. With TKproE the user can build or modify application programs while they
are running. This makes it possible to test program changes immediately without the cost of
compiling the application.

The application works on platforms Linux, OS X, Windows
