Installing TKproE
=================
TKproE is distributed in both binary and source code formats. 

Source code version
-------------------
TKproE installation is performed by extracting the distribution archive into a directory of your choosing. The subdirectory structure within the archive is expected by TKproE and should be maintained.

You will need the TCL/TK windowing shell (wish) installed on your system in order to run TKproE.


Binary (wrapped) versions
-------------------------
TKproE installation is performed by extracting the distribution archive for your operating system into a directory of your choosing.

The name of the executable file indicates whether the program is for a 32-bit or 64-bit version of the operating system.
